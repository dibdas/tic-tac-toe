### Rules of the tic-tac-toe game 

-The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.

-The first player is player1, and the second player is player2. Players take turns putting their marks either X or O.

-The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.

-When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a draw.
